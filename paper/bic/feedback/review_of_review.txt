A brief overview of the major comments, ignoring the minor ones here

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reviewer #1

 1]
 > find more existing segmentation literature
 > apply more existing segmentation techniques
 - remove 1.1
 2]
 > less medicine and context more imaging parameters
 - stronger note for application of proposed technique
 3]
 - no significant Compton scattering in our case (not sure that is true ???)
 > segmentation doesn't handle several types of artifacts,
   so it should be sufficient to remove section and refer to textbooks in intro
 4]
 > incorporate method section to introduction section
 5]
 - explain what "redundant information is"
 > assess preprocessing step
 6]
 > Remove R&D parts, reads like a historical novel
 > potential errors in diffusion field interpretation away from implant
 > more detailed description of variables f_diff + f_edt
 [7]
 > remove "basic operations" algorithms A1-A4, they don't add anything
 [8]
 > Make "results" section instead of the long "methods"
 - remove 4.6.1 since there is no 4.6.2
 > Validation, validation, validation (not just visually), use a assessment measure

Reviewer #2

 [1]
 - use of words slightly change meaning throughout (high fidelity, high res, distortive, aim vs objective)
 - avoid using references as subject of the verb
 - change section name "background" to "context/related work"
 - instead of commas, use \times for resoltution
 > Figure 1 colors are counter intuitive
 > Annotate Figure 1 to show where ROIs are from
 > Annotate Figure 2 with text and arrows
 > Figure 3 has negative voxels -> explain
 > Figure 3: check hor axis + change ver axis to %
 > Figure 10: elaborate on "note the difference"
