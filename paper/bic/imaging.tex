\section{Imaging artifacts}
\label{sec:imaging}

Noise in tomography is unavoidable, and it makes segmentation harder because it
further obscures the boundaries between materials.  Materials may be well
separated at some angles but overlap at other in the resulting projections.
The effects are manifested in the 3D-reconstruction as numerical shifts in
voxel values as a function of their position. This is a direct result of a
misrepresented attenuation along the axis of the incoming X-rays.  The
dependency on orientation illustrates how voxel intensity values are not
globally fixed. Instead, how a certain material is represented in intensity is
highly dependent on its position relative to neighboring regions. The same
material with the same density can thus be represented as multiple intensities
within the same sample.  Some noise can thus be uniformly distributed across
images, such as that removed by flat-field correction, while other noise is
very spatially dependent on its surrounding regions. By knowing the composition
and positioning of the materials being imaged, we can correct some of these
effects during segmentation.

We will refer to noise as voxels being numerically altered to obscure features
in the image, whereas artifacts are regarded as regions that falsely appear to
contain notable features.

In \Cref{fig:slices}, we see zoomed-in regions of the YX- and ZY-planes of the
same sample as shown in \Cref{fig:3viewsample}.  Our visual systems
automatically correct for most of the distortions. However, at various
distances from the implant, blood vessel voxels have higher values than bone
voxels further out. As we approach the implant, the value shifts accelerate and
become highly non-linear.  Both planes display a broad selection of the various
types of noise sources found in the data.

We will only cover the most dominant phenomena that result in noise
and artifacts affecting the reconstructed image. Many other sources will
likewise contribute noise and artifacts, but a full study is beyond the scope
of this work. The numbers in parentheses indicate the corresponding arrow in
\Cref{fig:slices}. Note that not all effects have a corresponding arrow.

% most pronounced effects are: streaks, glow, ring artifacts
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Erroneous volumes (4):} During sample preparation, the
		resin has not successfully filled out all crevices in the blood
		vessels. Instead, some air pockets are left within the resin,
		changing the effective density and thereby absorption. This is
		an effect which we cannot correct, because it is in fact
		present in our data. It appears in the tomographic slices
		\Cref{fig:slices} as dark spots in the otherwise lighter resin. 
	\item \textbf{Dark and bright streaks (3):} Streaking artifacts occur close to
	  regions with very high absorption, such as metal implants, but also
		to some degree in the transition from dense bone to softer
		tissue.  This effect is also called photon starvation, due to
		the lowered amount of photons reaching the detector through
		more hardened trajectories due to higher absorption
		\citep{srnoise}. Scattering around high density regions also
		makes up a significant contribution, adding to the streaking
		artifacts \citep{scatter_sr_ct}.
  \item \textbf{Cupping effect:} A commonly occurring artifact occurs when
	  beams pass homogeneous cylindrical objects. Since beams passing the
		middle will have to traverse more material compared to the
		edges, the beam is hardened more towards the center and
		intensity becomes lower as a result. This can manifest itself
		in what erroneously looks to be dense peripheral regions at the
		edges. A cupping effect also arises from scattering which leads
		to a reduction in low contrast sensetivity
		\citep{sr_streak_artifacts_scatter}.
  \item \textbf{Phase contrast:} Phase contrast is used to enhance the contrast
	  around soft tissue where the contrast from pure absorption is
		insufficient \citep{phasecontrast}. It can however also induce
		noise, such as fringes around the edges between different
		materials within the sample\citep{srnoise}. Similar to the dark
		and bright streaks artifacts, these effects show up as
		misrepresentations of the voxel values. This is especially
		prominent at the transitional edges between biological tissue
		and bone \citep{sr_streak_artifacts_scatter}.
	\item \textbf{Ring artifacts (2):} Looking at the XY-plane in
	  \Cref{fig:slices}(a) we see clear concentric ring artifacts emanating
		from the center of the sample, and at strong edges of the
		titanium implant. It propagates strongly through the large
		region of air behind the implant. This effect arises from
		imperfections in the scanner setup and is typically come from
		uncalibrated or defect adjacent detector elements. For
		synchrotron radiation sources it can also occur from shifts and
		vibrations in the monochromator crystal \citep{ringartefacts}.
  \item \textbf{Scattering:} Lower energy rays mostly contribute noise from
	  scattering effects. A ray will propagate through a material, get
		scattered and diffract from its initial trajectory. This gives
		a misrepresentation of the attenuation along its initial
		trajectory. The artifacts seen from scattering are similar in
		nature to those formed by beam hardening, due to how both
		phenomena effectively misrepresent the measured attenuation.
		For X-ray energy levels used for the data presented here, of 50
		keV and above, Compton scattering is the dominant type.
		Coherent scattering is not very dominating at 50 keV, but
		incoherent scattering slightly dominates for Titanium at 50
		keV. Incoherent Compton scattering will add an overall haze and
		reduce constrast in the image
		\citep{Compton}\citep{xray-attenuation-10-kev-100-mev}\citep{attenuation-cross-sections}.
\end{itemize}

% Continuity argument
In order for our probability distributions to be suitable for reliable
segmentation,  it is important to ensure that artifacts do in fact have a
continuous imprint.  Since the projections are acquired through rotations using
a very small step size (1/2000 of a degree) then the reconstructed volume can
be assumed to have smoothly/continuously varied features and also artifacts.
Also single projections are assumed to have continuous varying artifacts
because the projections are already heavily denoised, and it is mostly noise
which can be discontinuous. Using these probability distributions, we can build
a method to accurately identify materials across varying voxel values.
