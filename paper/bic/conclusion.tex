\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

While SRµCT yields 3D reconstructions of extremely high fidelity compared to
lab-grade X-ray setups, several distortion effects remain that obstruct
accurate tissue classification in important regions, in particular near and at
interfaces of high-contrast transitions such as where biological tissue meets
metallic implants. However, these effects are well-behaved, in the sense that
they vary smoothly over space, making it possible to discover approximate
mathematical models of the effects and counter their resulting distortion.

We were able to build probabilistic models for the distortive effects of soft
tissue and bone voxel values as functions of distance to the implant and as
functions of an approximate diffusion field. This made it possible to see close
to the implant surface, and automatically segment into tissue types throughout
the sample and all the way up to the implant surface, with high accuracy both
at long and short distances.

In this pilot work, we have only looked at utilizing the combined field and
distance transform to the implant surface. We have not yet compared the results
to histology microscopy, which is the gold standard for tissue classification.
However, the results are promising: the segmentation is successful, and the
tissue-to-implant contact can be studied quantitatively and qualitatively. The
method is also general and can be applied to other types of samples with
similar distortion effects.

In upcoming work, we plan a larger quantitative study that compares with
histology microscopy results, obtained from the same biopsies. In addition, we
are extending the method with a Bayesian combination of multiple ``angles'':
different sources of distortion effects (e.g. multiple physical effects) can be
better captured by different fields, e.g. beam hardening may be best captured
by the distance transform to the sample surface, while the diffusion field
captures distortion near metallic implants. Thus different fields separate
tissue material distributions in different regions and are expected to yield a
stronger analysis when combined. It is hoped that this will make it possible to
separate multiple highly overlapping frequency distributions.
