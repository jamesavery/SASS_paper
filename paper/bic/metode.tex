% Spatial correlation 2d histograms (den nemme, 1 2d hist)
In this section, we will describe the method for exploiting spatial correlation based on the
2D-histograms of the tomographies. We will start by motivating the problem, then give an overview
of how we solve the problem, with a final detailed walkthrough of each step in the overall workflow.

\subsection{1-dimensional histograms}
%diskuter overlappende materialer
Looking at a 1D-histogram of the voxel value in a tomography, as shown in~\Cref{fig:1d-hist}, we are
able to distinguish different distributions, but we see that there is a large overlap. This leads to
global thresholding being infeasible, at least for the distributions in the lower half of the histogram.
This happens because the voxel value is not globally defined, as~\Cref{sec:physics} explains, which
illustrates how the different materials cover ranges of values that blend together in the histogram.

    the red line is the soft tissue peak, the green line is the bone peak, and the orange line is
    the implant peak.}
    \label{fig:1d-hist}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Preprocessing}\label{sec:preprocess}
To reduce the complexity of the segmentation process, we preprocess the data by removing redundant
information. From our work in an upcoming paper under preparation, we are able to obtain two
masks: an \textit{implant mask} and a \textit{bone mask}.

Since the values of the implant material is radically different from the rest of the sample, obtaining
the rough implant mask through global thresholding is trivial, as the orange line in~\Cref{fig:1d-hist}
shows. This mask is then refined, along with the internal gaps being closed, giving us the implant mask.
Using this mask, we are also able to remove the air making up half of the sample cylinder. This is depicted
in~\Cref{fig:3viewsample}, above the implant and to the left of the implant in the XY and YZ cross
sections respectively. Finally the implant mask can show us the orientation of the implant. This squashes
the blue peak from the histogram, leaving the two peaks marked by the red and green lines as being
the most defined.

As we are only interested in the voxels inside the bone, and we know that bone is the most prominent
material left, we perform another coarse segmentation. This is done by thresholding between the two
large distributions, choosing everything to the right of this threshold as the bone mask. These voxels
are morphologically closed, to also consumes the internal gaps in the bone region, which makes up the
soft tissue inside the bone. The implant and bone region masks are applied throughout subsequent steps
to filter out noise in the tomography.

\subsection{Exploiting spatial information}
% Show the correlation of x,y,z,r to histograms 2d
As described in~\Cref{sec:physics}, the voxel values vary according to their positioning, motivating
us to utilize spatial information in the tomography. In order to include spatial information,
we consider \textit{expanding} a dimension to produce multiple 1D histograms into a combined 2-dimensional
histogram. Each 2D histogram is computed by locking the dimension in question and produce the 1D histograms.
Specifically, we consider the radius ($r$) dimension from the center of the implant, as the voxel values
vary most, closest to the implant. The algorithm for computing the 2-dimensional histogram for the
radius can be seen in~\Cref{alg:2dhists} with the resulting 2D histogram plotted in~\Cref{fig:2dhists}.
From this plot, we see two prominent distributions that change along the $r$ axis. This is however
not an accurate representation, as the edges of the implant are not uniformly spread across the longest
axis of the implant. This means that the radius does not sufficiently represent the distance from the
implant at high resolutions. This is shown in~\Cref{fig:edt-vs-diffusion}, where we see that a radius
of constant value from the center has varying distance to the implant.

\subsection{Field histograms}
%Show that the fields can perfectly seperate
%discuss all the way to implant contact
In order to obtain spatial information based on the relation to the implant, we construct two
\textit{field} representations: Euclidian Distance Transform (EDT) and Diffusion.

%EDT is good overall, but difficult close to the implant.
EDT computes each voxel as the Euclidian distance to the implant.  This makes for a generally good
representation for all but the voxels that are close to the implant. The shortcoming near the implant
is mainly due to the fact that the voxels in the grooves of the implant have the same distance, and
thus the same value, as voxels next to the threads of the implant. This is shown in~\Cref{fig:edt-vs-diffusion}.
As discussed in~\Cref{sec:beam-hardening}, the implant produces a \textit{glowin}g effect, which
should be corrected by having higher field values for voxels surrounded by implant.

%Use diffusion to "zoom in" on the implant, as it is good close to the implant, but throws everything far away into the same bin
To get better correction close to the implant, we utilize diffusion where the implant "glows" further
accumulating the value when a voxel is surrounded by implant. This is shown in~\Cref{fig:edt-vs-diffusion},
where the voxels in the grooves are affected by multiple implant voxels. A slice of the resulting
diffusion field can be seen in~\Cref{fig:field-slice}.

Diffusion is depicted in green, where we see multiple arrows contributing to the value of $p_1$. Using a radius of constant value, we see that the distance to the implant varies a lot.}
    \label{fig:edt-vs-diffusion}
\end{figure}

While diffusion works well on voxels close to the implant, it assigns the same value to the voxels
far from the implant. Therefore, an optimal solution is to use both the EDT and the diffusion field
to better represent both voxels that are far away, as well as the ones that are close to the implant.
We achieve this by adding the two fields together, producing a final combined field.

% Show that the distance to the implant in edt will be the same in the grooves of the screw compared
% to the threads of the screw. This is "fixed" with diffusion, as the grooves will be brigher as it
% is surrounded by more implant.

\subsection{Walkthrough of the method}
This section will describe each step of our method in detail. Going from tomography to a segmented tomography.

\subsubsection{Overview}
%Coarse steps, explain the idea
In order to reach the tissue-bone implant contact metric, we have the three coarse steps: compute the fields, segmentation using the fields, and extraction of the contact from the segmented tomography.

The steps of the field computation are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compute the EDT and Diffusion fields to give each voxel spatial information about its relation to the implant.
    \item Compute frequency distributions of voxel values as functions of field values as 2D histograms.
\end{itemize}

Then, in order to segment using the fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find the materials within the 2D histograms as ridges, using image processing techniques.
    \item From the ridges, compute initial approximate frequency distributions of each material, which are then optimized to fit the 2D histograms.
    \item From the optimized distributions, we derive probability distributions for material classification. These distributions approximate the conditional probabilities $P(m|v,x)$ that a particular voxel belongs to material $m$ given that it has voxel value $v$ and field value $x$.
    \item Apply the probability distributions to the tomography, segmenting the voxels into the different materials.
\end{itemize}

Finally, to produce the tissue-bone implant contact metric:
\begin{itemize}
    \item From the segmented tomography, we compute the blood network of the bone regions to further extract which soft tissue voxels that are blood vessels.
    \item This blood network is used alongside the the segmented bone to produce the final metric.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Segmentation}
The overall segmentation is computed in steps 1-5. For each step we will describe the process, showing
the algorithm where applicable, along with the the intermediate results.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent\textit{\textbf{Step 1: Field computations}}\\
Both fields are computed from the implant mask, as described in~\Cref{sec:preprocess}.
EDT is computed using the Python package \texttt{edt}~\cite{pypi-edt}. It takes the implant mask and
sets every non-set voxel to be the Euclidian distance of the nearest implant voxel.

For diffusion, rather than solving the diffusion equation, we approximate it using multiple convolutions
of a 3D-Gaussian kernel. Furthermore, instead of a single pass with a 3D-kernel, we apply 3 $\times$ 1D
convolutions, one in each dimension, to the tomography. This obtains the same result as a regular 3D-Gaussian
kernel. The algorithm can be seen in~\Cref{alg:diffusion}, and the XZ-plane in~\Cref{fig:field-slice}.

            \Return $buf_0$
        \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

%EDT + Diffusion
To obtain a good seperation both close to the implant and far away, we combine the two fields into a
single one as shown in~\Cref{eq:field-comb}.

    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent\textbf{Step 2: 2D histograms} \\
From the combined fields we compute a 2D-histogram with the field value on the y-axis and the voxel
value on the x-axis.  This allows us to see the distribution of voxel values, based on their
relative position from the implant. The algorithm for the field-histogram can be seen in~\Cref{alg:field-hist}
along with a plot of the resulting histogram in~\Cref{fig:field-hist}. We see that the voxel values
shift based on their closeness to the implant, which clearly results in two seperable distributions.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent\textbf{Step 3: Isolate the materials} \\
The next step is to isolate the different materials spatially, which is done through the field-histogram.
For our first attempt, we applied Otsu's threshold to each each row in the 2D-histogram. While this
provided good results for two well defined distributions, it eventually began to fail. This was either
because of lack of samples, or because the histogram did not contain two distributions, which is an
underlying assumption of Otsu thresholding. These two effects occurred at the edges (both closest and
furthest from implant), which would bleed into the later steps of the segmentation process.

Rather than finding the threshold value in between the distributions, our next solution was to start
finding the distributions by finding the ridges of the 2D-histogram. We do this by applying a series
of image processing techniques, described in~\Cref{alg:material}. Each of the resulting contours
become their own material, which are then labeled as material 1 or 2 respectively for this particular
sample. For samples that would contain more than two distributions, the same algorithm should apply,
as long as the distributions does not overlap.

\noindent\textbf{Step 5: Perform segmentation} \\
The final step of the segmentation process is to utilize the probabilities for segmentation.
This process is fairly straightforward, as each voxel is looked up in the probability distribution,
which carries the same shape as the field-histogram.

\subsubsection{Sub-classification of soft tissue}

With a good separation of soft tissue and bone, we map out the blood vessel network using connected
components analysis, which is visualized in the 3D renders in~\Cref{fig:blood-network}.
Here we see that we have successfully segmented the blood vessels out of the bone region.
It is especially prominent when looking at the capillary network, as we can see these in fine detail.
Noteworthy, the newly formed bone region (\Cref{fig:blood-new-slice}) contains a larger concentrations of these small blood vessels, compared to the old bone (\Cref{fig:blood-old-slice}).
If we zoom in to a small cube region (\Cref{fig:blood-old-cube} and \Cref{fig:blood-new-cube}), we see it even more defined, clearly seeing how the larger vessels connect through the smaller ones.

The osteocytes are selected by volume and shape: For every connected component
in the feasible volume range, its principal axis and best ellipsoid is computed and checked against
the potential osteocyte shape.

\subsection{Assessing bone-implant contact and blood-implant contact}

  \label{fig:histology-comparison2}
\end{figure}


Once segmented, tissue in contact with the implant can be studied using the
Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) from the implant, restricted to the bone region. We can
simply mask the voxels that are within a thin shell of distances, $d_{min} < d(x,y,z) \le d_{max}$,
for example $d_{min} = 1\mu m$ to $d_{max} = 5\mu m$. We then sum over the masked voxels of each
tissue type to obtain and divide by the total to obtain the tissue-to-implant contact per area,
or study the distribution across the surface area qualitatively.

A larger quantitative study is planned that analyses the full data set against recently conducted 
histological microscopy taken from the same biopsies. In the present work, we evaluate qualitatively:
Since the SR$\mu$CT tomograms are
clear enough that it is possible as humans to distinguish between blood vessels and bone,
as our mammalian visual cortex automatically corrects for the distortion effects, we can verify
the success of the automatic classification.

Figures \ref{fig:histology-comparison1} and \ref{fig:histology-comparison2} show the same 2D slices
as were shown in Figures \ref{fig:3viewsample} and \ref{fig:slices}, allowing us to visually inspect
them side by side. We can see that the automatic

% In this subsection, we show how to map the tissue-to-implant contact surface for visual inspection.
% The challenge is that the equidistant region forms a curved surface that cannot simply be flattened.
% Instead, we project the voxels onto a cylinder, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cylinder1}.
