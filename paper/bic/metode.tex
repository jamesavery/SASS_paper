\section{Method}
Spatial correlation 2d histograms (den nemme, 1 2d hist)

\subsection{1-d hist}
diskuter overlappende materialer

\subsection{Correlation of the different angles}
Show the correlation of x,y,z,r to histograms 2d

discuss the effects with references to the physics (previous section)

\subsection{EDT, diffusion}
Show that the fields can perfectly seperate

discuss all the way to implant contact

EDT is good overall, but difficult close to the implant. 

Use diffusion to "zoom in" on the implant, as it is good close to the implant, but throws everything far away into the same bin

Show that the distance to the implant in edt will be the same in the grooves of the screw compared to the threads of the screw. This is "fixed" with diffusion, as the grooves will be brigher as it is surrounded by more implant.
