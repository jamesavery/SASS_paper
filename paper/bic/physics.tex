\section{Physical effects}
\label{sec:physics}

Noise in tomography is unavoidable, and it makes segmentation harder because it
further obscures the boundaries between materials. Materials may be well
separated from certain angles in the 3D-reconstructed image but can overlap
from other angles. Some noise is very uniformly distributed across images, such
as the noise removed by flat-field correction, while other noise is very
spatially dependent on its surrounding regions. Knowing the composition and
positioning of the materials being imaged, we can counter some of these effects
during segmentation. The effects from noise manifest themselves as numerical
shifts in voxel values as a function of their position. This is a direct result
of a misrepresented attenuation along the axis the X-rays are passing.

This dependency on orientation illustrates how voxel intensity values are not
globally fixed. Instead, how a certain material is represented in intensity, is
highly dependent on its position relative to neighboring regions. Especially
since this also determines the amount and type of derived noise. The same
material with the same density can thus be represented at multiple varying
intensities within the same sample.

    To better see the distortion effects, we zoom in on two sub-regions of the
    slices shown in \Cref{fig:3viewsample}. Our visual systems automatically
    correct for most of the distortions, as they appear similar to illumination
    effects. However, even some distance from the implant, blood vessel voxels
    have higher values than bone voxels further out. As we approach the
    implant, the value shifts accelerate and become highly non-linear.

In \Cref{fig:slices}, we see zoomed-in regions of the YX- and ZY-planes of the
same sample as shown in \Cref{fig:3viewsample}. Both planes display a broad
selection of the various types of noise sources found in the data.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Beam hardening:} Medical CT and µCT both utilize poly-energetic
      beams, which can cause artifacts around high-density regions. This effect
        is called beam-hardening \citep{beam-hardening}, and occurs when rays
        with lower energy are attenuated more frequently, thus shifting the
        remaining photon energy to a higher effective average value. This
        offsets the local contrast, by overestimating the attenuation, leaving
        lighter spots on the image. Many types of artifacts will typically be
        present in X-ray setups, but most are taken into account by calibration
        using phantoms and pre-hardening the beam before it reaches the sample.
        Pre-hardening of the beam is done using filters that attenuate the
        softest rays. Due to its common usage, various metal artifact reduction
        (MAR) software exists to account for noise and imperfections during
        reconstruction \citep{mar1}\citep{mar2}.

    Despite the practically mono-energetic rays from SRµCT, the source
        initially generates a poly-chromatic spectrum. During
        monochromatisation the resulting spectrum can still contain corrupted
        harmonic components. Only a few percent corruption is enough to produce
        strong artifacts, although monochromatisation is typically done in
        multiple layers \citep{srnoise}. It can not trivially be rejected that
        some noise does occur from poly-energetic incident radiation. Two
        distinct effects typically seen as a result of beam-hardening are the
        dark and bright streaks and cupping artifacts in high-density regions.

  \item \textbf{Dark and bright streaks:} Streaking artifacts occur at the dense
    implant region, but also in the transition from bone to softer tissue. This
        effect is mostly seen in regions of large heterogeneity. When X-ray
        beams pass at angles containing multiple dense obstacles, the beam is
        hardened more. Then for angles with fewer dense obstacles, the energy
        spectrum is preserved better. This produced the dark and bright streaks
        seen in \Cref{fig:slices}.
        %
        For a hardened beam, softer X-rays are absorbed instead of successfully
        penetrating the object, and will not contribute to image formation.
        High-density structures such as the titanium implant break the
        isotropy, making the projected X-ray mean energy spectrum dependent on
        incident orientation \citep{srnoise}.

  \item \textbf{Cupping effect:} A commonly occurring artifact is when beams pass
    more homogeneous cylindrical objects. Since beams passing the middle will
        traverse more material compared to the edges, the beam is hardened more
        towards the center and intensity becomes lower as a result. This can
        manifest itself in what erroneously looks to be dense peripheral
        regions at the edges.

  \item \textbf{Phase contrast:} Phase contrast is an effect whose consequences
    are not very unlike those of beam-hardening.  Although used as an advantage
        in holotomography\citep{holotomography} and phase contrast
        tomography\citep{phasecontrast}, it induces noise in regular tomography
        such as those used here. It typically results in fringes around the
        edges of regions within the image\citep{srnoise}. Similar to the dark
        and bright streaks mentioned above, they show up as misrepresentations
        of the voxel values. In our case, they are especially prominent at the
        transitional edges between the titanium implant and the biological
        tissue and bone.

  \item \textbf{Ring artifacts:} Looking at the XY-plane in
      \Cref{fig:slices}(a) we see clear concentric ring artifacts emanating
        from the center of the sample, and at strong edges of the titanium
        implant. It propagates strongly through the large region of air behind
        the implant. Compared to the other artifacts mentioned, this effect
        arises from imperfections in the scanner setup. These types of
        artifacts can typically come from uncalibrated or defect-adjacent
        detector elements. For synchrotron radiation sources it can also occur
        from shifts and vibrations in the monochromator crystal
        \citep{ringartefacts}.

  \item \textbf{Projection artifacts:} Bright streaks with strong edges are
      seen from the sharp corners of the titanium implant. When doing back
      projection, a symmetry break is seen as smeared lines across the sample.
      This can occur from the high pass filter used during filtered back
      projection, which exaggerates the differences between adjacent elements
      \citep{ctnoise}.

  \item \textbf{Compton scattering:} Lower energy rays mostly contribute noise
      from scattering effects. A ray will propagate through a material, get
      scattered and diffract from its initial trajectory. This gives a
      misrepresentation of the attenuation along its initial trajectory. The
      artifacts seen from scattering are similar in nature to those formed by
      beam hardening. This is because both phenomena effectively reduce the
      measured attenuation. For energy levels relevant to the data presented
      here, of 50 KeV and above, Compton scattering is the dominant type
      \citep{Compton}. The scattering occurs due to photon-electron interaction
      between the X-ray beam and the material it passes through. Like
      beam-hardening, scattering will cause dark streaks across the image,
      where the attenuation was highest.
\end{itemize}

The distortions that come from the class of physical effects and noise
artifacts discussed in this section, will vary continuously as a function of
the spatial coordinates. This allows the possibility for a method, which can
correctly identify materials despite varying voxel values.
