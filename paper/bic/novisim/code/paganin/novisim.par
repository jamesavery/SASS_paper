##### Extra features PyHST ##### -- not used for now, and has been commented out
################################

DO_CCD_FILTER = YES                   # CCD filter (spikes)
# Setting this parameter to 1 activates a filtering on each projection. The treatement is applied after :
#      -background subtraction -division by the flat-field -double FF correction ... if these options are activated.
#            CCD_Filter: a median filter is applied on the 3X3 neighbour of every pixel. 
#  If the pixel value ( the higher the more photons) exceed the median value more then the �threshold� 
#   parameter then the pixel value is replaced by the median value.
CCD_FILTER = "CCD_Filter"
CCD_FILTER_PARA = {"threshold": 0.040000 }
#     When this option is on (1) a filtering is applied to the sinogramme trying to remove ring artefacts. 
#  This options was previously named DO_SINO_FILTER in pyhst1. The old names for this option are still compatible.
#
DO_SINO_FILTER = NO # Sinogram filter (rings)
SINO_FILTER = "SINO_Filter"
#   old option SINO_FILTER, now can be called "RING_FILTER" : in this case the sinogram is averaged over all the projections, then
#     a high-band pass filter is applied to the average and the result is substracted from all the projections.
#    The details of the frequencies filtering are specified through variable RING_FILTER_PAR
#    More details on the manual : Ring Correction 
ar = numpy.ones(2048,'f')
ar[0]=0.0
ar[2:18]=0.0
SINO_FILTER_PARA = {"FILTER": ar }
###  DO_AXIS_CORRECTION : When set to 1 ( or YES) this option activates the axis translation correction.
###    The first columns is the horizontal correction. The second , if present, the vertical correction.
###    The datas are the axis displacements. Positive value means positive displacement
DO_AXIS_CORRECTION = NO # Axis correction
AXIS_CORRECTION_FILE = N.A.
OPTIONS= { 'padding':'E' , 'axis_to_the_center':'Y', 'avoidhalftomo':'N'} # Padding and position axis
PENTEZONE=10 # Doing half-tomo, this defines the width of the overlapping regions around rotation axis

#PUS=0.0                                     # Sigma value in pixel units of unsharp filter.
#PUC=0.0                                     # Unclear? A coefficient used in conjunction with PUS.
#UNSHARP_LoG=0                               # Use laplacian of gaussian instead of gaussian itself for convolution kernel
#ZEROCLIPVALUE = 0.005                        # Minimum value of radiographs after flat / before log
